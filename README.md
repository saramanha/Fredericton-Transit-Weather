# Fredericton Transit & Weather Analysis

### Abstract
This study delves into the analysis of historical data
from Fredericton Transit and Fredericton Weather to unravel
commuters’ route preferences and underlying factors influencing
route popularity. The overarching goal is to offer data-driven
recommendations to the transit authority for optimizing the
public transportation system in Fredericton. Through analysis,
this project aims to refine the efficiency and convenience of public
transit, ultimately improving the overall passenger experience. By
leveraging insights gleaned from extensive data analysis, authorities can make informed decisions regarding route optimization
and system improvements.

### Conclusion
Transit systems are crucial, ensuring efficient connections
and smooth mobility essential for our everyday activities and
societal function. In conducting a holistic analysis of the
Transit System in Fredericton, we employed K-Means clustering to identify distinct user segments with unique Transit
Usage Behavior. Simultaneously, to capture the seasonal trends
inherent in the transit usage pattern, we complemented our
analysis by incorporating Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated
Moving Average (S-ARIMA) modeling. This addition allowed
us to discern and account for the temporal variations, providing
a more comprehensive understanding of transit user segments
and their anticipated behaviors. By integrating K-Means clustering and S-ARIMA, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on transit dynamics, enabling tailored strategies and
interventions to enhance the overall efficiency and satisfaction
of the transit system in Fredericton.

### Limitations
The data set exhibits potential class imbalance, given its
focus solely on users accessing Fredericton’s transit system
through the Hotspot App. This limitation introduces a bias
in the data, possibly skewing our understanding. Additionally,
the data set might not fully capture the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on transit ridership, potentially limiting the applicability of our findings. Moreover, there are uncertainties
surrounding the assignment of boarding stops, which rely on
estimations rather than in-depth analysis. This lack of detailed
analysis could affect our interpretation of transit patterns.
Lastly, considering the inherent limitations of the Hotspot
App, there’s a possibility that the data’s comprehensiveness
and accuracy might be compromised, ultimately impacting the
reliability of the insights we derive.
